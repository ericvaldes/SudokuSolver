# SUDOKU SOLVER GUI PROGRAM PYHTON

The main idea for the program:
  1. A window appears asking to fill numbers in grid
  2. A button is pressed to solve the sudoku
  3. The unfilled spaces are filled with the answer
  4. A timer shows how much does it lasts to fullfi


What do we need to learn for this program?
  1. A GUI framework
  2. Python structure
  3. Git (Create a repository in github and make commits)

Python structure:
  1. Main file where all the action is called
  2. A script that handles the creation of the GUI
  3. Transformation script from user input to data and from results
     to output
  4. A script to obtain compute the results

Possible continuations:
  1. Change the input method to be a photography
  2. Make it a mobile app
  3. Show the step

Libraries to use:
  1. GUI: I propose tkinter as a fast and initial framework. Once the program is done, we can move out from it and use something more fancy
  2. Numpy: To find a solution using matrices, which let us avoid the use the for loops.
